# StudErn

StudErn is a platform where students and dropouts can fill the gap of finding available jobs and internships around them with also introducing micro jobs to recruiters. Our mission is to combat root-level unemployment, equip students with real-world experience, and provide financial opportunities during their education.

- Recruiter Dashboard: A dedicated space for recruiters to post jobs, manage applications, and connect with potential candidates.
- Resume Builder: An easy-to-use tool for applicants to create professional, ATS-compliant resumes.
